##### EMMAROSS INTERNATIONAL

# MY-PROJECT
The aim of this project was created with the notion of creating a marketing website using the technologies I have learnt from the preliminary stage of the course using tools such as, HTML, Css, and Bootstrap or other libraries. The major function of the website is to present useful information in an ordered way to a set  users friendly site.
So I choose to created a website for Emmaross International. I have putting into consideration all the modules I have learnt to create this responsive website.
My site consists of a homepage to introduce the company and the goods they have in stock.and a gallery page to choose from.

## DESIGN 

**__Colour Scheme__**

* I used two colours to design this website, black, purple and white colour respectively. I alternated the text and background colour between my two main colours to create defined sections when scrolling and to create a slight monochrome feel.
* I also used a blue colour for my hover effect on the links to show the user that there is an element in a form of a link.
 
 **__Typography__**

* I wanted to create a strong look with my typography so i used a very Arial in large size for both headings and all other text.
* No font was imported.
 
 **__Imagery__**

* Images are essential in the decoration of the website.
* There are images used in both the gallery ssssand the homepage for consumers to know what they are about to do.
* I placed this images there for consumers to access it's quality brand.
* Images where taken from shutterstock images.
* I used two sources for my images.

 **__Icons__**

* I used icons from Font Awsome to encourage users to scroll and to show links to a seperate section page on any media platform.

  Git

   * Git was used as a version control in the terminal.

   * jQuery was imported from bootstrap to make the navbar responsive on smaller screen sizes.

## TESTING

  * My code has been passed throught the W3C, Css and HTML validator.

# Further Testing

Once finished I tested the site across different screen sizes and different browsers.

1. I noticed the gallery section was not responsive the way it should be unless clicked on before the gallery page pops up.
2. I also noticed my social media links where not arranged the way I wanted it but it's working.
3. I've also checked all links numerous times to make sure they all work.
4. I also had a problem with the css as well with minor errors    

## DEPLOYMENT
 
 **__Github, Gitpod, Git and Gitub pages__**

* To start the project I used Github and Gitpod.

1. I first created a repository cloning the Code Institutes template on my github page.
2. Once created I opened the page in Gitpod.
3. I then used the terminal to create my index.html file.
4. I then created my assets folder to hold my images.
5. I then created the style.css file within the css folder.
6. I then created the other pages for gallery.html.

* Git

1. Once I created the main files and folders I then used the git add . command to add them to the staging area.
2. Once they were staged I then used git commit -m "initial commit" to commit them to github.
3. I then used git push to push the files onto my gihub page.
4. I used these steps to commit the project regularly throughout the development to keep everything saved and up to date on my github.

* To make my project live I then used github pages.

 1. I First signed into github and located my repository
 2. At the top of the repository I selected the settings option.
 3.   I then scrolled down the page until I reached the github pages section.
 4. Under sources I selected the Master Branch.
 5. The page then refreshed itself.
 6. I then scrolled back down and the link to my live page was then visible.
